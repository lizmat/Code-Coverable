Revision history for Code::Coverable

{{$NEXT}}

0.0.10  2025-01-11T15:04:24+01:00
    - Bump dependencies where appropriate
    - Apply the initial set of heuristics on "coverables",
      and introduce the :raw named argument to it

0.0.9  2025-01-10T15:00:25+01:00
    - Add line 1 again, as it *can* be a valid line as well

0.0.8  2025-01-08T16:31:35+01:00
    - Remove test for coverable-lines script: it turns
      out it is too fragile on a bare install

0.0.7  2025-01-08T16:17:56+01:00
    - Hopefully fix "bare" installation test issue
    - Always remove line 1 from coverables from bytecode:
      it is coverable even if there isn't any code, and it
      is always covered, so there's no information there

0.0.6  2025-01-07T13:22:20+01:00
    - Add "key2source" subroutine to convert a coverage key
      to an IO::Path of the associated source file
    - Fix README.md snafu

0.0.5  2025-01-07T11:42:58+01:00
    - Fix issue in "coverable-lines" script
    - Updated documentation a bit

0.0.4  2025-01-06T21:41:31+01:00
    - Add Code::Coverable class
    - Rename "coverable-files" subroutine to the more
      appropriate "coverables", as it now returns a Seq
      of Code::Coverables objects

0.0.3  2025-01-01T15:17:29+01:00
    - Add dependency on MoarVM::Bytecode
    - Allow identities to be specified as well as paths
